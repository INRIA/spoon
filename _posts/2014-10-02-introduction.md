Spoon enables you to transform (see below) and analyze Java source code (see example) . Spoon provides a complete and fine-grained Java metamodel where any program element (classes, methods, fields, statements, expressions...) can be accessed both for reading and modification. Spoon takes as input source code and produces transformed source code ready to be compiled.

You can view a technical presentation [here](http://spoon.gforge.inria.fr/source-code-analysis-transformation-spoon.pdf) and slides [here](http://www.monperrus.net/martin/lecture-slides-source-code-analysis-and-transformation.pdf).
