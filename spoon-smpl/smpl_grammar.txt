First milestone SmPL grammar:
    
    Adapted from http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/docs/main_grammar.pdf
    
    
    
    Note: This grammar is incomplete as it does not cover dot modifiers <...> and <+...+>,
          pattern disjunction (p | ... | p) and conjunction (p && ... && p)
          
          These constructs are to be part of the first milestone but could not be
          trivially lifted from the official grammar PDF as they are buried in the
          C-specific parts of that grammar.
    
    
    
    program        ::= include_cocci* changeset+
    
    include_cocci  ::= #include string
                     | using string                        patch-local isomorphism definitions?
                     | using pathToIsoFile
                 //  | virtual id (,id)*
    
    changeset      ::= metavariables transformation
                 //  | script_metavariables script_code
    
    metavariables  ::= @@ metadecl* @@ | @ rulename @ metadecl* @@
    
    // rulename    ::= id [extends id] [depends on] [scope] dep [iso] [disable-iso] [exists] [rulekind]
    rulename       ::= id
    
    metadecl ::= identifier ids ;
               | type ids ;
               | expression [list] ids ;
               | statement [list] ids ;
               | constant ids ;
               | JavaType ids ;         
               // too much removed to include here
    
    ids ::= pmid (, pmid)*
    pmid ::= id | mid
    mid ::= rulename_id.id
    
    transformation ::= OPTDOTSEQ(top, when)
    
    top ::= java_expr | java_decl_stmt+ | java_fundecl          this is where the java lives
    
    when ::= when != when_code
        // | when any                     lifting shortest path restriction
        // | when strict                  applicable to error states (how are these determined?)
           | when exists                  not all paths need to match
           | when forall                  all paths must match the complete rule
        // | when true != expr
        // | when false != expr
    
    
    OPTDOTSEQ(grammar, when) = [... (when)*] grammar (... (when)* grammar)* [... (when)*]
    
    
    
    
    Notable omissions in first milestone:
        
        dots in method calls: foo(...)
        "when any" lifting of shortest-path restriction for dots
        "fresh identifier" metavariables for code generation
        constraints/regexes on metavariable ids
