The code in C4JShouldVibrate.zip has been modified according to should_vibrate.patch,
essentially changing a single method signature as follows:

    - protected Void doInBackground(MediaDatabase.MediaRecord... records)
    + protected Void doInBackground(MediaDatabase.MediaRecord records)

Neither the method nor the file it lives in are relevant to the associated C4J patch. 
The reason for the change is that Spoon produces an error when pretty-printing the 
original file/CU using the DefaultJavaPrettyPrinter, which is possibly a bug in Spoon.
