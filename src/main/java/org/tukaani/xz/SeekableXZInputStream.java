/**
 * Decompresses a .xz file in random access mode.
 * This supports decompressing concatenated .xz files.
 * <p>
 * Each .xz file consist of one or more Streams. Each Stream consist of zero
 * or more Blocks. Each Stream contains an Index of Streams' Blocks.
 * The Indexes from all Streams are loaded in RAM by a constructor of this
 * class. A typical .xz file has only one Stream, and parsing its Index will
 * need only three or four seeks.
 * <p>
 * To make random access possible, the data in a .xz file must be splitted
 * into multiple Blocks of reasonable size. Decompression can only start at
 * a Block boundary. When seeking to an uncompressed position that is not at
 * a Block boundary, decompression starts at the beginning of the Block and
 * throws away data until the target position is reached. Thus, smaller Blocks
 * mean faster seeks to arbitrary uncompressed positions. On the other hand,
 * smaller Blocks mean worse compression. So one has to make a compromise
 * between random access speed and compression ratio.
 * <p>
 * Implementation note: This class uses linear search to locate the correct
 * Stream from the data structures in RAM. It was the simplest to implement
 * and should be fine as long as there aren't too many Streams. The correct
 * Block inside a Stream is located using binary search and thus is fast
 * even with a huge number of Blocks.
 *
 * <h4>Memory usage</h4>
 * <p>
 * The amount of memory needed for the Indexes is taken into account when
 * checking the memory usage limit. Each Stream is calculated to need at
 * least 1&nbsp;KiB of memory and each Block 16 bytes of memory, rounded up
 * to the next kibibyte. So unless the file has a huge number of Streams or
 * Blocks, these don't take significant amount of memory.
 *
 * <h4>Creating random-accessible .xz files</h4>
 * <p>
 * When using {@link XZOutputStream}, a new Block can be started by calling
 * its {@link XZOutputStream#endBlock() endBlock} method. If you know
 * that the decompressor will only need to seek to certain uncompressed
 * positions, it can be a good idea to start a new Block at (some of) these
 * positions (and only at these positions to get better compression ratio).
 * <p>
 * liblzma in XZ Utils supports starting a new Block with
 * <code>LZMA_FULL_FLUSH</code>. XZ Utils 5.1.1alpha added threaded
 * compression which creates multi-Block .xz files. XZ Utils 5.1.1alpha
 * also added the option <code>--block-size=SIZE</code> to the xz command
 * line tool. XZ Utils 5.1.2alpha added a partial implementation of
 * <code>--block-list=SIZES</code> which allows specifying sizes of
 * individual Blocks.
