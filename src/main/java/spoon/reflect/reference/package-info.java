/**
 * 	<p>This package defines the references to program elements for the meta-model.</p>
 * 	<p>References usually correspond to elements defined in the {@link spoon.reflect.declaration} package. It is
 * 	a weak reference system which allow referencing elements that do not exist yet, or which are defined
 * 	outside of the reified program model. In that last case, some functions use regula Java reflection instead of
 * 	Spoon reflection and referenced elements should be in the classpath.</p>
