	<p>This package defines the Spoon's compile-time meta-model of Java programs.

    <p>The meta-model defines a read/write compile-time meta-representation of Java 5 programs.
    The programmers should instantiate or resolve the meta-elements by using {@link spoon.reflect.Factory}'s sub-factories because it ensures
    the model consistency. The {@link spoon.reflect.CoreFactory} is the raw factory for program elements and is the
    only factory to be implemented when wanting to provide an alternative implementation of the Spoon meta-model.
