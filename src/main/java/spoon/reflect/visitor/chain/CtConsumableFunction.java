/**
 * Represents a function, as {@link CtFunction}. However, the main difference is that
 * while a {@link CtFunction} returns something with a standard Java return keyword,
 * a {@link CtConsumableFunction} returns something by passing the returned object
 * as parameter to the given outpuConsumer#accept. This enables to write efficient and concise code in certain situations.
 * It also enables one to emulate several returns, by simply calling several times accept, while not paying
 * the code or performance price of creating a list or an iterable object.
 *
 * It is typically used as parameter of {@link CtQueryable#map(CtConsumableFunction)}, can be written as one-liners
 * with Java8 lambdas:.`cls.map((CtClass&lt;?&gt; c, CtConsumer&lt;Object&gt; out)-&gt;out.accept(c.getParent()))`
