 * {@link CtBaseQuery} represents a low level query, which can be used to traverse a spoon model and collect
 * children elements in several ways.<br>
 *
 * <br>
 * Use {@link CtQueryable#map(CtConsumableFunction)}}, {@link CtQueryable#map(CtFunction)}} or {@link CtQueryable#filterChildren(Filter)}
 * to append a next query step.<br>
 *
 * The main methods are:
 * <ul>
 * <li> {@link #map(CtFunction))} - uses a lambda expression to return any model elements that are directly accessible from an input element.
 * <li> {@link #map(CtConsumableFunction))} -implementations of {@link CtConsumableFunction} provides a complex queries.
 * <li> {@link #filterChildren(Filter))} - uses {@link Filter} instances to filter children of an element
 * <li> {@link #list()} - to evaluate the query and return a list of elements produced by this query.
 * </ul>
 * The {@link CtBaseQuery} can be used several times by calling of {@link #apply(Object, CtConsumer)}.<br>
 * Reusing a {@link CtBaseQuery} instance makes sense when the same query has to be evaluated
 * several times in a loop.
 *
 * The instance of CtBaseQuery is not thread safe! So use it always only in one thread.
 *
 * @param &lt;O> the type of the element produced by this query
