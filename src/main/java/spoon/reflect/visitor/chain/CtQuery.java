/**
 * CtQuery represents a query, which can be used to traverse a spoon model and collect
 * children elements in several ways.<br>
 *
 * <br>
 * Use {@link CtQueryable#map(CtFunction)}} or {@link CtQueryable#filterChildren(Filter)} to create a new query starting from an existing element.<br>
 *
 * The main methods are:
 * <ul>
 * <li> {@link #map(CtFunction))} - uses a lambda expression to return any model elements that are directly accessible from an input element.
 * <li> {@link #map(CtLazyFunction))} -implementations of {@link CtLazyFunction} provides a complex queries.
 * <li> {@link #filterChildren(Filter))} - uses {@link Filter} instances to filter children of an element
 * <li> {@link #list()} - to evaluate the query and return a list of elements produced by this query.
 * </ul>
 * It makes sense to evaluate this query only once, because the input element is constant.<br>
 * A CtQuery is lazily evaluated once {{@link #list()}} or {@link #forEach(CtConsumer)} are called.
 * Usually a new query is created each time when one needs to query something.
 * If you need to reuse a query instance several times, for example in a loop, then use {@link CtBaseQuery}.
 *
 * @param &lt;O> the type of the element produced by this query
