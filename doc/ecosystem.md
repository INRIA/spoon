Old projects using Spoon
------------------------

* [SpoonJDT](https://gforge.inria.fr/scm/viewvc.php/spoon/trunk/spoon-jdt-core/) was an Eclipse plugin for Spoon based on Spoonlets.
* [SpoonLoader](http://mir.cs.illinois.edu/~bdaniel3/spoonloader/) was simple facade to load and modify Java source code(by Brett Daniel).
* Another maven plugin was made by David Bernard ([link to the project](http://alchim.sf.net/spoon-maven-plugin/)).
