# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The only supported version is the latest major version. Security fixes are not
backported to earlier releases.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability in Spoon, please disclose it by email to any of the
integrators listed in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

If you have the capability to do so, we appreciate if the email body is
encrypted. You can get the GPG key of a contributor with the `gpg --recv-keys
<key_id/fingerprint>` command. Integrator key fingerprints are listed alongside
email addresses in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.
