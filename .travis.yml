# in langage:java, Travis executes by default "mvn install -DskipTests=true -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -B -V"
# This is not what we want because:
#   - it executes checkstyle (we have a specific job for this)
#   - it's useless ("mvn test" later does all the necessary tasks automatically)
#   - it makes the build longer (we want a fast job)
